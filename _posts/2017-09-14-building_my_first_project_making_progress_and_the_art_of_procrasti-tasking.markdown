"Just make progress." 

Avi Flaubaum repeated a version of this mantra several times in his video walkthrough of creating a Ruby Gem.  It's not unlike Nike's "Just do it," Dori's "Just keep swimming," or Yoda's "There is no try"--lines I enjoy quoting righteously to others and essential to programming.  But I have a confession:  I may be the most indecisive human being on the planet.  No, that's a gregious understatement.  Whether it's picking out a box of granola bars, shopping on Amazon (all those reviews!), or...ahem...writing a blogpost, commiting to an action before I've thought through at least a dozen viable possibilities and ruled out potential adverse consequences (several of which are on par with nuclear war), is something I just don't do.  

Allow me to go off for a bit to illustrate my point.  Recently, I broke the glass caraf on my coffee pot. I thought about just ordering a replacement, but as the appliance was a wedding gift nine years ago, I figured there might be a better product out there.  So began an epic quest for the perfect coffee brewer.  I scoured the internet and read hundreds of reviews from dozens of websites.  I deliberated. I compared. I contrasted. I screenshoted and saved to carts and dreamed of brewing cycles and percolation.  How could there be so many different kinds, ranging from $34.99 to thousands of dollars?  Was it even possible to be content with one's coffee-making apparatus? But you know what?  I loved every minute of this process.  Well, right up until I was forced to make a decision because my husband's highly rigid morning routine requires brewing coffee at precisely 4:13 AM, and thus his life was quickly descending into chaos. Oh, the pain of choosing! I prevailed, however, only to discover multiple subphases of my coffee quest while reading the manual (yes, I am one of those people).  Prior to this experience, I knew very little about coffee besides the fact that I liked it with a splash of milk or milk-related product as soon as possible after waking and perhaps a few more times throughout the day.  I welcomed it equally from the office breakroom, the YMCA, Starbucks, or the ever-changing local coffee shop around the corner.  But alas, my blissful ignorance was no more.  I now needed fair-trade, freshly roasted whole beans to accompany my brewer, and wait, I must grind these beans!  Google search: best coffee grinders...

All that to say, I thrive on deliberation, weighing choices, ideating unforseen possibilities. Getting "bogged down by details" does not feel boggish at all to me; rather, it's my element!  Sometimes, however, it's nothing more than a warm blanket of comforting procrastination.  Finally, reader, we have reached the point of this blogpost.  It hit me while working on my very first project as a developer-in-training that my revulsion to decision-making may reveal more than just a personality quirk.  This point in the curriculum would be the first time that my work would truly reflect my abilities (and inabilities), and it paralyzed me.  I would literally have to "commit" work every few minutes.  I did not have enough intel to make these decisions!  I watched videos, revisited old work, reread my notes, ordered yet another book on Ruby, read the Slack channels, looked at examples, and then sat trembling before my blank text editor in a cold sweat.  "I'm not ready! I don't know what I'm doing!" I cried out.  You see, my greatest fear is not heights or spiders or snakes.  It's incompetence.  I tend to avoid doing anything until I'm confident that I can at least appear like I have my shit together.  I had never been faced with this feeling of complete inadequacy with absolutely no way to avoid it.  

Then I remembered: "just make progress." I wish I could say that it was smooth sailing after this revelation, but that is far from the truth.  I am now putting the finishing touches on my CLI scraping gem--three weeks after I started the first component of this group of projects.  What should have taken me a week was derailed by periods of procrasti-tasking; I baked, cleaned, organized, and internet shopped (well I put a lot of things in my "save for later" list).  I eventually built projects that are not up to my standards, but they work, and that is an f-ing triumph.  The feedback is going to sting a little, but I'm going to get better because of it. 

Before I decided to completely uproot my life and become a developer, I was a middle school teacher.  In educator circles, "grit" is often touted as the most important skill for student success. Grit enthusiast and researcher Angela Duckworth once wrote, “The gritty individual approaches achievement as a marathon; his or her advantage is stamina.”  Stamina is certainly important, but I've got plenty of that.  I can work on a project for for..ev..er.  What I needed to get through this was a willingness to be open and vulnerable--to acknowledge that I was a fledging but attempt to fly anway.  As Ray Bradbury's wrote in *Fahrenheit 451*, "If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you, and you'll never learn."  Another line I loved to preach to my students while encouraging them to "just try!" I get it now.  It's hard to put yourself out there, especially when you know what people are seeing is far from impressive or noteworthy.

I'm thankful that the culture at Flatiron School is so open and honest about what is feels like to learn something new.  At the beginning, I was so sure that I wasn't the kind of person who would ever get scared and want to quit.  I've always been fiercely determined and capable of just figuring things out.  I was so wrong.  Hitting the submit button on this project is going to feel like Frodo trying to throw that ring into the lava of Mount Doom. It might take losing a finger.

My English teachers were always getting on to me for mixing my metaphors, but I need just one more. I know next to nothing about gardening besides the fact that you have to trim certain kinds of shrubs and trees to get them to grow right.  They look terrible when they're pruned, but it's for their own good.  I'm like that stubby crepe mrytle in the winter. It's kind of humilating, but I'm going to be an obnoxiously pink, blossoming wonder, dammit.  Just you wait.

Oh, and Justin, my husband, hates change perhaps more than I hate making decisions.  He despised our new coffee maker and ordered the replacement caraff for around $20 on Amazon.  We now have his and her coffee makers. There's a moral in there somewhere, but I'm way too stubborn to acknowledge it.
