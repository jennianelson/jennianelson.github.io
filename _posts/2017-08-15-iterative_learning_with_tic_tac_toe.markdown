This post is centered around one of the toughest labs early on in Flatiron's curriculum: build a playable Tic Tac Toe game in the CLI using procedural Ruby.  We later made an OO version as well.  Because this post grew to be very long and technically specific to this project, I've included just my personal reflections below.  You can read my technical explanations for each component [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTdT8NaLGnBhVAzBV59VI2O0QDwSbYNO90Qawhgcs8jFLXpT-AcGQz6VT0sfcAExBwvyUUgvBpisvIp/pub).

As a programming newb, I’m full of excitement and hungry for information, but much of what is discussed in the programming world is still over my head at this point.  I tune in anyway, picking up tidbits here and there, but it’s also nice to find resources that speak to me where I am.  I’m really enjoying reading *Learn to Program* by Chris Pine, and I’ve recently stumbled across a delightful podcast called *Developer Tea*.  Most episodes are 10 minutes or less, so the idea is that you can listen when you take a “tea break” (or whatever your “tea” happens to be).  I learn something helpful every time I listen, but I never feel overwhelmed or defeated.  In fact, it leaves me feeling the exact opposite--encouraged, motivated, and ready to learn something new.  Today I listened to an episode called “Iterative Learning” and it was exactly what I needed to hear.

Iterative learning is a process in which you don’t worry about fully mastering a concept the first time through; instead, you give yourself a wide variety of experiences with it--such as seeing it represented visually, finding examples of it being applied in the world, listening to experts on the subject, doing small, focused practice, teaching it to others--and then circle back through it again.  I especially love how the host Jonathan Cutrell explains his process for iterative learning (give it a listen!).  
As I go through the Learn.co curriculum, I often wonder if the learning is “sticking” or if I’m merely grasping it long enough to pass the lab.  I get so focused on checking off lessons that sometimes I lose sight of my overall goal: to actually learn how to program.   Therefore, in the spirit of focusing on learning rather than speed, I decided to put aside my checklist for today and iterate back over a lab I found incredibly challenging when I first started the program: Ruby Tic Tac Toe.

I set out to contrast the procedural and object oriented versions of this, but since explaining the procedural version took ALL DAY LONG, and I’m hungry, I’ll stop with just that one for today.  I hope that someone finds this helpful, but regardless, my understanding of procedural ruby deepened enormously because I made myself do this.  Two thumbs up for iterative learning!
