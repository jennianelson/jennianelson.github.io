> We're all fixed in good faith in a certain concept of ourselves.  However, while you keep yourself in order, holding on with both your hands to your holy habit, there slips down from your sleeves, there peels off from you like...like a serpent...something you don't notice: life! Has it never happened to you to find a different self in yourself?  Have you always been the same?>  Luigi Pirandello, *Henry IV*

Our stories are never really linear.  In Lois Lowry's 1994 Newbery acceptance speech for *The Giver*, she compares the the inspiration for her novel to the springs and tributaries that feed into a river.  What led me to start my programming journey were countless experiences and realizations, but I'll see if I can piece together some of it in hindsight.

My world-view went through a dramatic transformation in my early twenties.  I've always been fascinated by philosophy, religion, and how people view the world.  I also just really loved learning.  I had a tough time declaring a major in college because I wanted to take EVERYTHING.  Becoming a teacher had always been in the back of mind, but being an education major meant no time for exploring other subjects.  I settled on English, knowing that I could get my teaching certificate and masters after graduating.  One day while perusing the course catalog (one of my favorite things to do) I saw this funky English/Religious Studies combo class.  I could get credits toward my major and try out a new subject?  Yes, please.  That class was a game-changer.  I was surrounded by an incredibly diverse group of people who were all there for different reasons.  I had never felt so challenged and intrigued by a class.  Opinions clashed more often than not, and the tension in the room could get pretty uncomfortable, but I started to notice my own blinders and biases.  The Religious Studies department, although small, offered classes which topics included religion's relationship to existentialism, Tibetan Buddhism, Nietzche, the Holocaust, pop culture, and science.  I jumped in head first, and over the next three years, these classes taught me how to think, research, write, teach, speak, and learn better than any others.  I also gained the confidence to go after just about anything.
 
I still wasn't sure teaching was the right fit for me, but I had a lot of respect for the profession.  I wanted to do what my teachers and professors has done for me--inspired, motivated, nurtured, and challenged me out of my comfort zone.  I worked in the restaurant industry,  got through graduate school, and eventually landed in a middle school teaching reading and English.  I fell in love with this age group, and they quickly cured me of any pretentiousness.  They made me laugh and broke my heart and I wanted them to have everything they deserved out of life.  I also saw how inadequate the education system was in helping every child be successful.  It rewarded only one type of person and did little to teach the skills needed to navigate today's world.  It became my mission to give education a "face lift."

During my eight years as a middle school teacher, I learned a lot about my own strengths and weaknesses. I was really good at redesigning established systems, expectations, and protocol to move education in a direction that better prepared and motivated all kids. My colleagues often came to me for help with technology because I was constantly seeking out tools that helped make daily tasks like grading, feedback, learning, and assessment more effective, efficient, and enjoyable.  My "happy place" was spending hours playing with spreadsheet formulas, Google Apps add-ons, and the HTML on our district website and LMS.  I even started drifting down the hall to check out what was going on in our robotics and computer science classes.  My job as an English teacher, however, was to, well, teach; I had to motivate, inspire, and build strong relationships with 120+  seventh graders every year, and I started to realize that I my role involved using my weaker traits more than my strengths.  I craved more balance and an opportunity to see what I could do with that other, more logistical side of my brain.  

It was the perfect time to make a change.  I had been messing around with HTML for years, but why not really learn how to code?  I got hooked immediately when I tried out a course on Code Academy.  It felt like I had finally found what my brain was wired to do.  I was already way overcommited with everything I was involved in at school, so I knew I wouldn't be able to learn and continue my current position.  I always told my students not to let the fear of failure keep them from trying, so I had to walk the talk. After about a year of thinking, researching, and soul-searching, I had a tearful converstaion with my incredible administrators, and resigned from the familar world of education to start over as a clueless newb in the world of software development.

People often nask me what I want to do/where I want to work.  While Iâ€™m full of ideas, I'm even more excited about the possibilities I don't know about yet.  I shouted "Yes!" countless times when I read an article that Flatiron School's co-founder Avi Flaumbaum wrote called "Coding is Awesome." Here's one part that really resonated with me: 

>On one level programming allows us to build things like Wikipedia and put the wealth of human knowledge at our fingertips. And many of our favorite websites and applications profoundly change the nature of the human experience for the better. Code, in this sense, is a philosophical framework for thinking about how to better the world. By gaining this skill you are learning a craft that shapes the world, and with that will come opportunities to change the world.

So that's why I'm here--in hopes that I can use my strengths and passions to make the world a little better.
